### One morning I left home.
I was walking to the bus station, when
### I suddenly fell into mud.
I wasn't sure why I tripped over, but
### I got up and kept going, despite being being covered in mud.
I, however, hadnÂ´t tied my laces properly.
I walked for a while and then
### I fell again, this time on concrete.
As I was still lying on the ground my phone started ringing.
### Biki called me to ask whether I was on my way.
I had already walked for too long to turn around and go back home so I finally tied my shoes properly,
### I caught the bus and
### I rode to the train station.
When I got there, I looked like I had just lost a mud fight and
### my friends laughed at how unlucky I was.
In the end I was able to get to school and get changed, but I will never forget this absurd story.
